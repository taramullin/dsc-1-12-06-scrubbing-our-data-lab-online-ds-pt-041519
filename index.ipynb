However, in this dataset, we'll notice that although the `Store` and `Dept` columns are both contain integer values, we can intuit that these are meant to be read as categorical data.  We'll want to convert these columns to strings, so that they will be one-hot encoded when we get around to dealing with our categorical columns.  \n",

    "You may be wondering why we don't just leave it as is.  This is because we would accidentally be creating numeric relationships between the different stores that shouldn't be there.  If left with numeric encoding, our model would interpret Store 2 as twice Store 1, but half of Store 4.  These sorts of mathematical relationships don't make sense--we'd much rather these be treated as categories, as the dataset intends.  \n",

Dropping the markdown columns is also not an ideal solution, as they likely contain good information that will be useful in our modeling steps. We need to investigate examples of what non-null data in these columns to determine if how we should bin the data, but binning and converting the columns to categorical so that we can one-hot encode them is probably the most useful solution here.\n",
